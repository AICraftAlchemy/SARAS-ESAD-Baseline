## Pytorch implementation of RetinaNet
## OHEM Loss, Focal Loss, and YOLO Loss on top of FPN
This repository implements a pure pytorch [Focal-Loss for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf) paper. Aim of this repository try different loss functions and make fair comparision in terms of perfromacne/speed/gpu-memory.
